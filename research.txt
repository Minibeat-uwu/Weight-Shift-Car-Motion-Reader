Most of the informations are researched around the surrounding resources that are found online. 

The mechanical property of the pressure sensor:

In the wii fit board, it contains total of 4 sensors, 1 on each legs. 

The sensor is identified as strain gauge:
- it increases it's resistance depending on the amount of tension/pressure applied to the metal's structure.
- Is it possible to remove the sensor? No, because it's glued to the rectangular metal in the center.

Possible methods to increase the resistance
1) constrct a finer pressure point so that it would increase the resistance with smaller amount of force
2) modify the code within the controller to increase the sensitivity


1) Physical Method
What I need to know:
- How much pressure it needs to send out specific amount of resistance?
- Is this small amount of voltage change allows me to catch it with arduino?

* There will be more, but I'll ask when it comes up.

2) Programming Method
Wii fit board uses a simple bluetooth to connect to wii, and it can also connect to pc with no problem. Many people have already used it for many other purpose. However, the problem is:

- Can you modify the sensitivity on that externally/bluetooth?
  -> There are wii controller for pc, however can that modify the sensitivity that are sent from the system?
- If not, can I receive the data/number from the bluetooth?
  -> The issue with this is, can it sense a weight that is less then 1kg?
  -> How can I read the data that are sent through bluetooth?
