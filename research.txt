The mechanical property of the pressure sensor:

In the wii fit board, it contains total of 4 sensors, 1 on each legs. 

The sensor is identified as strain gauge:
- it increases it's resistance depending on the amount of tension/pressure applied to the metal's structure.
- Is it possible to remove the sensor? No, because it's glued to the rectangular metal in the center.

Possible methods to increase the resistance
- one of the possibility is to constrct a finer pressure point so that it would increase the resistance with smaller amount of force
