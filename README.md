# Side Force Reader for Car
I just found a wii fit balance board in value village. After thinking about what to do, why not this.

There are bunch of rough drivers out there who quickly press their acceleration, snap their wheel, hitting the break too hard, etc. 
One of the good example is Spongebob's driving! This can cause alot of issues not only to the surrounding and the car itself, but my main focus was to the passenger with motion sickness. Wouldn't it be nice if the passenger didn't feel any force from the car/rough driving? Thus, by reading the amount of force using this WONDERFUL DEVICE and warn the driver that your driving sucks, it might at least improve his driving skill. XD

Basically, wii fit balance board is a giant weight shift controller created from Nintendo right? If that's the case, if I have a platform where a weight cart rolling around due to the car's movement, it might be able to read the amount of force from the centripital force right? That cart also has to be tensioned to the center though, but by understanding the tension force from the center and reading the position of the weight cart, it might be able to read it.

It's large, there are much better ways out there, but hey why not.

Dismentalled the board to analyze the internal. It was basically 4 weight sensor at each legs.

The connection through bluetooth is fine, but I the WiiMote (driver) isn't properly connecting to the board. Actually, lets just code this thing with java.
