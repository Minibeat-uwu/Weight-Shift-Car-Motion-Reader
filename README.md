# Side Force Reader for Car
I just found a wii fit balance board in value village. After thinking about what to do, why not this.

There are bunch of rough drivers out there who quickly press their acceleration, snap their wheel, hitting the break too hard, etc. 
One of the good example is Spongebob's driving! This can cause alot of issues not only to the surrounding and the car itself, but my main focus was to the passenger with motion sickness. Wouldn't it be nice if the passenger didn't feel any force from the car/rough driving? Thus, by reading the amount of force using this WONDERFUL DEVICE and warn the driver that your driving sucks, it might at least improve his driving skill. XD 

TBH, this was also kinda inspired from the Water Cup Practice that was done by Takumi in Initial D.

Basically, wii fit balance board is a giant weight shift controller created from Nintendo right? If that's the case, if I have a platform where a weight cart rolling around due to the car's movement, it might be able to read the amount of force from the centripital force right? That cart also has to be tensioned to the center though, but by understanding the tension force from the center and reading the position of the weight cart, it might be able to read it.

It's large, there are much better ways out there, but hey why not.


For now, I made some research and is currently recorded on the research.txt. That reserach is still in progress as well and can be further improved with new ideas or methods. 

For now, lets go with the cheap option: Programming method.... cause I don't have any money XD.

## Programming Method:
Connection with Bluetooth using external program: 100%
  -> Issue: It connects for the first time, but I have to forget and redo the connection from scratch when I turn it off. There might be a fix to it, but haven't found it yet.
  Program I used for controller setting: https://www.julianloehr.de/educational-work/hid-wiimote/
  
Reading data/number: 15%
  -> Got the controller setting, however it needs quite a pressure to even get the sensor going.

Modification: 0%

Construction: No where close baby
